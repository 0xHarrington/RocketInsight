# RocketInsight Data Prototyping Environment

## Overview

The `prototyping` directory within the RocketInsight project serves as a sandbox for experimenting with and prototyping the backend's on-chain data interfaces, as well as server database management strategies. This environment is primarily structured around Jupyter notebooks, enabling a flexible and interactive approach to data analysis, visualization, and preliminary backend logic testing.

## Objectives

- **On-Chain Data Exploration**: To prototype interactions with blockchain data, particularly focusing on the Ethereum network and the rETH token dynamics within lending and borrowing platforms.
- **Database Management Prototyping**: To design and test database schemas and management strategies that efficiently handle the storage, retrieval, and processing of on-chain data.
- **Algorithm Development**: To develop and refine algorithms for data analysis, risk assessment, and market insights that will be integrated into the RocketInsight platform.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and Jupyter installed.
2. Navigate to the `prototyping` directory.
3. Install required Python libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Launch Jupyter Notebooks with `jupyter notebook` and explore the available notebooks.

## Notebooks Description

The directory includes several Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of the data prototyping process:

- **Blockchain Interaction Prototypes**: Notebooks dedicated to experimenting with web3.py for real-time and historical data extraction from the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Notebooks that utilize Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data analysis and insights generation.
- **Database Management Strategies**: Notebooks outlining proposed database schemas, along with prototyping of data insertion, querying, and management operations.
