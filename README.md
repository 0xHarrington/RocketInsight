# RocketInsight: Enhancing Transparency in rETH Market Dynamics

## Abstract

RocketInsight emerges as an innovative project developed by a group of computer science graduate students with the aim of increasing transparency and providing a comprehensive risk assessment tool within the RocketPool community and for the rETH liquid staking token. This project is designed to offer a detailed dashboard that presents real-time insights into market dynamics, evaluates major lending and borrowing pools, and assesses the overall health of the RocketPool ecosystem.

Our goal is to establish a publicly available platform that not only monitors the current market conditions of rETH but also analyzes historical data to assist rETH holders in identifying market instability and risk indicators. RocketInsight includes various tools, such as a wallet network view and a real-time market statistics feed, enabling users to assess market participant behaviors and gain an understanding of market health efficiently.

## Project Ideals

The foundation of RocketInsight is built on the principle of empowering users through data-driven decision-making tools. By providing detailed market insights and risk analysis, we aim to facilitate informed decision-making within the complex domain of cryptocurrency investments and decentralized finance (DeFi). Our approach to user interface design emphasizes simplicity and accessibility, intending to make RocketInsight a benchmark for analytics tools in specialized communities like RocketPool.

## Codebase Overview

The RocketInsight codebase is organized into three primary directories, reflecting the project's comprehensive approach to data analysis, web development, and blockchain technology integration:

- **frontend**: Contains the code for the user interface, developed using React, Redux, and D3.js to create interactive data visualizations.
- **backend**: Includes the server-side logic, utilizing Flask for data service provision and web3.py for blockchain data interaction.
- **prototyping**: Focuses on data analysis and prototyping, employing Jupyter notebooks and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for initial data exploration and analysis.
TBD: Set up create-react-app on WSL (Encountering errors)

Temporary fix: Used npm-windows installer to install npm and create-react-app.
