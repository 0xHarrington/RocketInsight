# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# RocketInsight: Enhancing Transparency in rETH Market Dynamics

## Abstract

RocketInsight emerges as an innovative project developed by a group of computer science graduate students with the aim of increasing transparency and providing a comprehensive risk assessment tool within the RocketPool community and for the rETH liquid staking token. This project is designed to offer a detailed dashboard that presents real-time insights into market dynamics, evaluates major lending and borrowing pools, and assesses the overall health of the RocketPool ecosystem.

Our goal is to establish a publicly available platform that not only monitors the current market conditions of rETH but also analyzes historical data to assist rETH holders in identifying market instability and risk indicators. RocketInsight includes various tools, such as a wallet network view and a real-time market statistics feed, enabling users to assess market participant behaviors and gain an understanding of market health efficiently.

## Project Ideals

The foundation of RocketInsight is built on the principle of empowering users through data-driven decision-making tools. By providing detailed market insights and risk analysis, we aim to facilitate informed decision-making within the complex domain of cryptocurrency investments and decentralized finance (DeFi). Our approach to user interface design emphasizes simplicity and accessibility, intending to make RocketInsight a benchmark for analytics tools in specialized communities like RocketPool.

## Codebase Overview

The RocketInsight codebase is organized into three primary directories, reflecting the project's comprehensive approach to data analysis, web development, and blockchain technology integration:

- **frontend**: Contains the code for the user interface, developed using React, Redux, and D3.js to create interactive data visualizations.
- **backend**: Includes the server-side logic, utilizing Flask for data service provision and web3.py for blockchain data interaction.
- **prototyping**: Focuses on data analysis and prototyping, employing Jupyter notebooks and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for initial data exploration and analysis.
TBD: Set up create-react-app on WSL (Encountering errors)

Temporary fix: Used npm-windows installer to install npm and create-react-app.
